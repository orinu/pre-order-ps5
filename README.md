# pre-order-ps5
https://www.geektime.co.il/coders-that-use-coding-for-life-hacks/

So I tried to order PS5 in pre-order a few times, but with a toddler with no nursery (covid) and a doctor for a wife (covid), until I managed to get in and order it ran out. 
Kravitz announces they will open a late pre-order (aren't they the ones?? who sells ink for 700â‚ª?). 
So I wrote a little script that will check every 10 seconds if the pre-order opened (without overflowing??or harming the servers of course), and when that happens, will trigger a notification in IFTTT, and have Alexa ???
** The code was built for personal use and out of necessity, this post was published only after the pre-order ended, in order not to harm or overflow the servers by multiple requests
