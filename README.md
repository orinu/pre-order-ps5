## General

I tried to order PS5 in pre-order a few times, but with a toddler with no nursery (covid-19) and a doctor for a wife (covid-19), until I managed to get in and order it ran out. 
Kravitz announces they will open a late pre-order (aren't they the ones who sells ink for 700â‚ª?). 
So I wrote a little script that will check every 10 seconds if the pre-order opened, and when that happens, it will trigger a notification in IFTTT, and have Alexa go crazy :). 



The code was built for personal use and out of necessity, this was published after the pre-order ended, in order not to harm the servers by multiple requests
